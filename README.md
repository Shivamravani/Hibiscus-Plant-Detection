# Hibiscus Flower Classification Web App 🌺

This project is a web application built with **Flask** and **TensorFlow/Keras** that allows users to upload or capture images of hibiscus flowers and classify them into one of three species using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## 🧠 Model

The model (`hibiscus_cnn_model.h5`) is trained to classify images into the following categories:
- `Hibiscus_rosa-sinensis`
- `Hibiscus_sabdariffa`
- `Hibiscus_mutabilis`
